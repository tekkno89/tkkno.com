I've lost count of how many blogs I've started, hopefully this one sticks and you get something out of it. One of the things that brings me the most fulfillment and satisfaction in life is sharing with others and helping people to grow and succeed. While I'm sure the majority of my posts will be related to technology, I would like to share things that I find interesting and useful outside of tech.

I hope you enjoy what you find here. If there is anything you would like to see, I'm always open for suggestions.
